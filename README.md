# super-simple-modmail
This is an extremely and elegantly simple framework of a Discord mod-mail bot that just works without many complex features or configuration required. It can serve as a baseline for a more complex Discord mod-mail bot if you so choose. It is written with the `discord.js` Discord API wrapper in JavaScript and can be run with Node.js.
